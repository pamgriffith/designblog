{% image big 2011/06/wufoo-cta.png alt="They have screenshots of many custom forms created with the product on the right. On the left is a very large 'WUFOO' logo and a simple tagline ('making forms easy + fast + fun') above a green 'Sign up for Free!' button and a blue 'Tour' button. Neither button is de-emphasized, but the green sign up button contrasts more strongly with the red background." %}

Wufoo does not have a big tagline and a description like many other calls to action; instead, they use a large version of their logo and a small tagline. They still have a logo on the top as well, but it's smaller than on other pages. (This is actually changed in a more recent redesign so there isn't a logo on the top at all on the homepage, the big logo replaces it entirely.)

Both calls to action are buttons, but the green sign up button shows up a bit more strongly against the red background. The sign up button emphasizes that sign up is free.

The image on the right is screenshots of custom forms created with their product.
