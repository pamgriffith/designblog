Facebook allows you to use the site without verifying your email address, but they add a bar to the top of the page that tells you to verify your email address, resend the email, or change your email address. They also offer a button to take you to your webmail account (presumably only if it matches something they know, like hotmail, yahoo, gmail, etc.)

Resend email sends the email again and brings up a confirmation dialog to say so, and suggests you check your spam folder. The dialog also has a link to my webmail account.

Be sure to check your spam folder.' It also has a 'Go to your email' link and an ok button." %}

Change email gives me a dialog with the current email address they have on file and a form field that lets me change it.

Submitting the change email form brings up a second dialog that tells me what my new email address they have for me is, that they've sent another confirmation email to it (with another suggestion to check my spam folder), and another link to my webmail account.
