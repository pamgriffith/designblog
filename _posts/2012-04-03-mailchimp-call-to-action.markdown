{% image big 2012/04/mailchimp-cta.png alt="The call to action section features a large cartoon chimp (their mascot) on the left and text on the right. The heading on the right is very large white and promises 'Easy Email Newsletters.'' Text below is a dark blue, which fades with the blue background a bit, and the call to action below that is orange and says 'Sign Up Free' in white text." %}

Mailchimp's call to action has a large image to one side and a heading, descriptive text, and single call to action button. The Heading text is extremely large and descriptive text is de-emphasized. The sign up button contrasts nicely with the background and emphasizes that sign up is free. The mascot image, which is used throughout their site, emphasizes the brand personality rather than showing the product itself.
