last.fm's logo is larger and in a different place on their logged out homepage than it is on other pages. Tagline and text are above the call to action button, which is followed by details about how long the process takes and what happens next. Right image changes to show different sources (iPhone, desktop media players) importing into last.fm with additional text that says the service is free. There aren't really any secondary calls to action here.</p>
<p>I had trouble figuring out how to <strong>not</strong> to continue as a new user here until I realized that the log in button wasn't actually a submit button on the search form.</p>
