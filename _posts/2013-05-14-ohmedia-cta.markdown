Call to action is part of slideshow, text and button position remains constant but what it links to keeps changing as slideshow changes. Text on right with project name, screenshot on left, slideshow mini screenshots below. Further secondary calls to action below, less emphasized than "see the case study" for each featured project&mdash;emphasizing getting started for new customers less than past work, perhaps on the theory that if you like what you see you'll read enough to find it?
