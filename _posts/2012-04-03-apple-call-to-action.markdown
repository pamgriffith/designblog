<p>Apple dominates their front page with an ad for one of their newest products. It has the image, large headline, and slightly smaller details but it lacks an actual call to action button. Instead, the entire region (text and image) is a link to a product page and the entire thing is a graphic. This screenshot is also a bit different from many home page calls to action in that the text sits in the negative space between the laptop screen and keyboard so the image is not entirely on one side and can be much larger. Other products change the placement of the image and text according to their respective forms.</p>
