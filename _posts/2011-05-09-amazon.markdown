Amazon has multiple kinds of recommendations. They have the most as "Today's recommendations" in a carousel, then just a couple of upcoming or new recommendations, and a couple things from your wishlist.

New users are prompted to rate things so Amazon knows what to recommend.

Amazon allows you to fix your recommendations by excluding some ratings or purchases from influencing the recommendations
