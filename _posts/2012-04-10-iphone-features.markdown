Apple product pages all have their own design. The iPad features page has a big image of the phone, a tagline, and some technical details, then some thumbnails linking to additional information further down in the page. The sections for each feature have varied layouts. Some have a tagline and description above a full-width image carousel, some have the same but with tabs, some have a smaller tagline and text with the image on the left or right.
