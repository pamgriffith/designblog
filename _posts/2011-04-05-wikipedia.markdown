Wikipedia has the languages with the most articles in a ring around their logo, each with Wikipedia's tagline in that language and the number of articles written in that language. Further languages are written below, divided into sections by number of articles in that language so more popular wikipedias are near the top.

There is also a search box on the homepage with a language selector next to it so you search the appropriate version of wikipedia. That language selector is just an alphabetical dropdown menu.
