Google books aggregates reviews from multiple sources. They differentiate between "editorial reviews" (reviews from people whose job it is to write reviews, I guess), and "user reviews" (user-generated content on sites like Goodreads). They allow filtering by star rating, editorial vs user review, and source of the user review.</p>
<p>Individual reviews give the star rating, user name on the source site and name of the source site, and the beginning of the review. There is a "read full review" link back to the source site on each review.</p>
