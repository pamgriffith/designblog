<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" title="journal-article-psycnet" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;journal-article-psycnet.png" alt="At the top is large blue text saying "Record Display". Below that are the buttons "save", "print", "email", "export", and "add to my list". Below that is a box with the heading "Citation", which contains the citation information including the article title and author; these do not appear elsewhere in the screen. Below that box is another box containing the abstract. To the right is a box with the heading "Links" containing a link to download and a link to the journal table of contents above a lot of empty space." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div></p>
<p>The article title is almost hidden in Psycnet journal article pages. An unhelpful "Record Display" title appears at the top where the title might be expected, and the title itself is buried in normal-sized text in the Citation box. The Abstract appears in a second box below, and the link to purchase or view the journal table of contents appear in a links box to the right. Additional links to save print, email, export, or add the article to a list appear above the Citation, which other journals might show in the right side below the purchase link. No price is given for the article.</p>
