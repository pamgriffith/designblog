Yelp reviews can be rated as helpful, funny or cool. Reviews with more votes appear first.

{% image big 2011/05/yelp.png alt="A review with 'useful', 'funny', and 'cool' rating buttons at the bottom. Each button has a counter next to it for how many of that type of vote it's gotten." %}

Reviews can be marked that yelp knows the reviewer has actually been there, and how often (if they've checked in).

Reviews can also be marked if the reviewer has been rewarded for being a good reviewer in the past (by helpful, funny and cool votes). The following review was a review of the day and the reviewer was Yelp Elite in 2011.

Store owners can also reply to reviews. The are marked as being from the store owner and appear with the review, not as a separate review or comment.
