<p>Twitter allows you to use the site without verifying your email address, but there's a bar across the top of the page that tells you to confirm your email address and where the confirmation email was sent and allows you to resend it, update your email address, or learn more about email verification.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" title="twitter-email-verification-bar" src="http://commonplacedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter-email-verification-bar.png" alt="A bar across the top of twitter with the text "Confirm your email address to access all of Twitter's features. A confirmation message was sent to [redacted email]" There are links to resend confirmation, update email address, and learn more." /></figure></div><br />
The resend link pops up a small notification below the navigation.</p>

The update email address link actually goes to the normal create account page. The email field is empty, but there is a box above it that says what they have and that you need to confirm it. It also has a link to resend the confirmation. The top bar has slightly different text (probably by accident) and no longer has a link to update your email address on this page.</p>

The email field is empty, and above it there is a note that says "Check your email [redacted email address] to confirm. Resend confirmation"" /></figure></div><br />
Using the update link on the account page loads a "resending confirmation" with a spinner graphic below it. This disappears after a moment and there doesn't appear to be any additional confirmation that anything has happened.</p>

The learn more link goes to a page in twitter's help center about what email confirmation is, why you might behaving trouble receiving the email, and what happens if you don't do it.</p>

Text explains what email verification is, helps troubleshoot verifying your email, and explains what happens to your account if you don't." /></figure></div></p>
