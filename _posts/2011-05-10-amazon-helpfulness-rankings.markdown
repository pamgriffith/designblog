Raters can mark Amazon reviews as helpful or not. Each review is marked by how helpful it is, and more helpful reviews are sorted to the top. Other trustworthiness signals are also provided if available, such as that the reviewer below provided his real name and that he's ranked as one of the top 500 reviewers on Amazon according to helpfulness ratings, reviewer location, and whether amazon knows if the reviewer actually bought the product.

Further information is available about the reviewer on clicking his name:
