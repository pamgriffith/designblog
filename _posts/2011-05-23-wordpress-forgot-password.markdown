Wordpress has a pretty standard but clear forgot password feature.

First it wants either your username or email.

The email it sends you makes it clear what password is being reset and gives you a big link to click.

The page to change the password has a strength indicator along with a hint about how to make stronger passwords. It does not constrain what characters you can use, beyond minimum length.
