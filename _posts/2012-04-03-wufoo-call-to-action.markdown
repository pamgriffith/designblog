<figure><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;wufoo-cta.png" alt="They have screenshots of many custom forms created with the product on the right. On the left is a very large "WUFOO" logo and a simple tagline ("making forms easy + fast + fun) above a green "Sign up for Free!" button and a blue "Tour" button. Neither button is de-emphasized, but the green sign up button contrasts more strongly with the red background." title="wufoo-cta" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126" &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><&#47;a></p>
<p>Wufoo does not have a big tagline and a description like many other calls to action; instead, they use a large version of their logo and a small tagline. They still have a logo on the top as well, but it's smaller than on other pages. (This is actually changed in a more recent redesign so there isn't a logo on the top at all on the homepage, the big logo replaces it entirely.)</p>
<p>Both calls to action are buttons, but the green sign up button shows up a bit more strongly against the red background. The sign up button emphasizes that sign up is free.</p>
<p>The image on the right is screenshots of custom forms created with their product.</p>
