Gawker's default view of comments limits the visible comments to just "featured" ones. You have to go to the "All" tab to get everything.

The "All" tab shows more comments, but not all of them. There is a "Show all discussions" link at the bottom to get comments that have been hidden (commenters with no or low reputation get the comments hidden automatically).

Hidden items show up in gray in between black items that were there before, no new page load, very disconcerting (where is the stuff I was looking at? where is the top?) "Show earlier discussions" loads comments inline below.
