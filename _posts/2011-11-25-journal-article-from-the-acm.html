<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" title="journal-article-acm" src="http://www.commonplacedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/journal-article-acm.png" alt="At the top left is a box with a black 1px outline with the article title, purchase link, authors, a screenshot of the journal with its name, issue, and link to table of contents, screenshot of the article with the date, and download information. To the right of that box is a gray box with another purchase link, various ways to save or download citations, and social sharing buttons. Below the gray box is a list of tags. At the bottom is a feedback link, a link to view without tabs, and a tab box with Abstract (selected), authors, references, cited by (unavailable for this), index terms, publications, reviews (unavailable), comments, and table of contents." /></figure></div></p>
<p>Unlike most of the other articles, information hierarchy is communicated on the ACM journal article pages mostly through boxes, not typography. There is large box that contains the name, authors, information about the journal it appears in, a link to buy the article and the number of downloads. To the right of that is another box with another purchase ink and various save and export options, with tags below. Below both boxes is a third, full-width box with tabs for the abstract and other metadata, some of which is also in the top box. Overall the design seems a lot messier than the other journal article pages.</p>
