Whitehouse.gov's We The People program has a javascript overlay for registration.

After registering, you are not logged in. The sign in and create account buttons remain and the petition you are looking at is topped with a notice that you need to verify your email address in order to sign in and participate in the site.

{% image big 2011/10/wethepeople-signup-confirm.png alt="Whitehouse.gov and We the People header above a note saying 'IMPORTANT: You have not finished creating your account. You will receive an email from us shortly. You must click on the link in that email to continue.' The petition appears below with sign in and create account links. The 'sign this petition' button is disabled." %}
