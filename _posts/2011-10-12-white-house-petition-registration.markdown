<p>Whitehouse.gov's We The People program has a javascript overlay for registration.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" title="wethepeople-signup" src="http:&#47;&#47;commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;wethepeople-signup.png" alt="A petition and sign in and create account buttons just visible behind a large blue box containing a create account form." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
