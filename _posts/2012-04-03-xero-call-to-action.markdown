{% image big 2012/04/xero-cta.png alt="A headline ('Pleasure Doing Business') and two lines of descriptive text with a green pill-shaped call to action button ('Try Xero for free pay when you want') and a simple non-underlined link secondary action ('Find out more'). On the right is a screenshot of the web application and an image of an iphone application." %}

The primary call to action here is a multi-line button that emphasizes that you can try the product for free. The secondary action is relatively de-emphasized, just a non-underlined link the same color as the rest of the text. The image included with the call to action shows that it's available on the web and on the iPhone.
