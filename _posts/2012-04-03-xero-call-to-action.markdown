<figure><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;xero-cta.png" alt="A headline ("Pleasure Doing Business") and two lines of descriptive text with a green pill-shaped call to action button ("Try Xero for free pay when you want") and a simple non-underlined link secondary action ("Find out more"). On the right is a screenshot of the web application and an image of an iphone application." title="xero-cta" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><&#47;a></p>
<p>The primary call to action here is a multi-line button that emphasizes that you can try the product for free. The secondary action is relatively de-emphasized, just a non-underlined link the same color as the rest of the text. The image included with the call to action shows that it's available on the web and on the iPhone.</p>
