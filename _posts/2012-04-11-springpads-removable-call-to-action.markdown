<figure><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;springpad-dismissable-cta.png" alt="A yellow banner along the top with a headline ("introducing smart notebooks.") a subheadline, and 3 sign up buttons in a row (sign up now, sign in with twitter, sign in with facebook). "Dismiss" with a small x icon appears in the top right. Below the banner is Springpad&#039;s logo and navigation." title="springpad-dismissable-cta" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><&#47;a></p>
<p>Springpad has a call to action banner above their logo and navigation. There is no image, but it does have the usual large tagline, smaller text (in this case a second tagline, not a longer description), and calls to action. The unique part is that there is a dismiss button at the top right, which removes the call to action banner and brings the logo and navigation up to the top. Once you've seen (and acted on) this call to action you never need to see it again, so why not have it stop taking up space? However, Springpad seems to have missed a trick in that reloading the page brings the call to action right back--why remove it if you just see it again the next time you visit?</p>
