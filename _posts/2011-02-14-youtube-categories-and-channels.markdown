YouTube has categories, channels, and tags. Categories and channels are most prominent.

Popular categories on the homepage:

Each channel has its own themed page with a list of playlists:

When playing a video, you see details about the playlist and a list of other videos in the list:

There is a page with more details about the playlist and a list of all the videos in it:

Videos can be tagged, but it just works like a regular keyword search:
