jQuery has two download versions, but just one call to action button for the both of them. There is a (highly styled) radio button selection toggles between production and development code. On the one hand the single button is simpler, but on the other it feels like the extra text required in and to explain the radio selection adds more noise than a second, de-emphasized button would. The text to the left of the radio selector and button is a nice example of providing compact bullet points below the tagline and text.

The conference announcement in the screenshot also provides a lot of noise that distracts from their primary call to action, but is aimed at a different set of people than would probably need the introductory text and call to action.
