Mailchimp divides their features into a number of sections. Each section has a heading, description, and screenshot, then several sub-features and descriptions with "learn more" links. At the bottom of the page is an index of all features by category. There is a link to sign up at the top and the bottom of the page.

The longer description of each feature that the overview links to is divided into even further sections with a paragraph or so of text for each. Below that are links to more resources and guides and names and descriptions of related features. This page also has the index of all features at the bottom and links to sign up at top and bottom.
