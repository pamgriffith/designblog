Tagline, text, minimum price, & available countries on left. Button doesn't have price, says "try" and "free" (for free trial). Images on right of all the platforms it's available on.

With flash disabled still has a call to action similar to above but much smaller and with a generic music note image. Page is mostly empty except for error box saying flash must be enabled. Call to action is not available to be clicked on until error message is closed.
