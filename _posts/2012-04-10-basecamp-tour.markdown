The basecamp tour page has a big tagline and screenshot at the top, a bunch of smaller taglines, descriptions, and screenshots of various features in the middle, and at the bottom a bulleted list of smaller features with links to more information for each, as well as some stats proving their reliability, then a form to sign up for a free trial.
