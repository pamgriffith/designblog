The spotify features page has tabs on the left for each feature. The first is an overview, and it has a screenshot of the various devices Spotify works with above a grid of features, each with an image and description and link to the tab with a longer description.

The tabs for each single feature have multiple sections with a heading, a few paragraphs of text, and a screenshot alternating left and right. At the bottom are links to next and previous features.
