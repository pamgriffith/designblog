Apple has a small US flag icon in their footer.

Clicking on it brings up a screen full of country flags and names. It's not just a language selector, as many countries in the list may have the same language but may have other localization needs as well.

Countries with multiple languages (e.g. Switzerland) are represented multiple times with the name of the country in each language.
