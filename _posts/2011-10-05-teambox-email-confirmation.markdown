<p>Like Facebook and Twitter, Teambox allows you to use the site before confirming your email, but there's a banner across the top of the site asking you to confirm it. It also allows you to resend the confirmation email or change your email address.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45" title="teambox-email-confirmation-banner" src="http:&#47;&#47;commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;teambox-email-confirmation-banner.png" alt="A yellow banner appears across the top of the page. It says "Go to [redacted email address] to confirm your account." There is a button to "resend the instructions" and a link to "use a different e-mail address"." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
When you resend the confirmation email you go to a page that includes instructions about why you might be having trouble finding the email. The page adds a second banner saying they've resent the email, it seems to appear on all pages after that.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46" title="teambox-email-confirmation-resend" src="http:&#47;&#47;commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;teambox-email-confirmation-resend.png" alt="The same yellow banner as before appears across the top of the page. A second green banner saying "We've re-sent the activation email. Take a look at your inbox!" appears below the navigation. Page text says "Confirm your email" with additional instructions and reasons why you might not see it." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
Clicking "use a different email address" takes you to an account settings page where you can update your email address, user name, and other settings.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" title="teambox-email-confirmation-change-email" src="http:&#47;&#47;commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;teambox-email-confirmation-change-email.png" alt="The same yellow and green banners appear as before. The page heading is "Your account settings" and there are form fields to change username, email, and other settings." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
The confirmation email has a large link back to the site. However, when you click the link you get redirected to the home page and apparently logged out. There's no confirmation message or additional instructions. At that point you are forced to log in again.</p>
<div class="figure-wrapper">

The box is followed by a url to copy and paste if the link fails, an email address for help, and why you received this email." &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
