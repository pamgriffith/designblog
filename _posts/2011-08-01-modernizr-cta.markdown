Modernizer has multicolumn format with their call to action in a reversed contrast box at the top center with a primary, secondary, and tertiary call to action. Primary is bright and pink at the bottom, secondary is still a button but gray with low contrast with the background, and tertiary is just a link. Primary and secondary actions have additional details about what happens next ("configure your build" or download size).
