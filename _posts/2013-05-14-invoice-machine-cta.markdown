The Invoice Machine homepage features a large abstract computer-ish(??) icon thingy, a tagline, a couple of lines of description, and two small-ish call to action buttons. The buttons are fairly subtle but stand out with a surrounding blue glow instead of background color. Neither icon is primary or secondary.
