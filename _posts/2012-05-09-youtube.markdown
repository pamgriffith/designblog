Stanford uses YouTube channels and playlists to present online course videos.

Each course is a playlist of videos. Clicking a course playlist brings up a truncated description of the course and a list of videos in the course. Stanford has labelled theirs with "Lecture N | Course Name".

Each course (playlist) also has a dedicated page with the full description and list of videos.
