<div class="figure-wrapper">
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14" title="mog-cta" src="http://commonplacedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/mog-cta.png" alt="Headline and text above call to action button, image of media player on various devices swaps in and out on right. Available devices and secondary actions (styled like links) are below the call to action button." /></figure></div><br />
Headline and text describes what the product does, with changing image showing various places MOG is available on the right (TV, computer, media players). Red call to action button ties in with other red items on the page like the logo, but stands out quite well; text on the button emphasizes that you don't have to pay right away, and arrow on the right side of the button emphasizes movement to the next step.</p>
<p>The secondary actions are styled like links and very de-emphasized. There is text about the devices that MOG is available on between the main call to action and the secondary actions (Learn More, See MOG in Action), which make it look like the secondary actions are also about the devices rather than standing as separate alternatives to the primary call to action.</p>
