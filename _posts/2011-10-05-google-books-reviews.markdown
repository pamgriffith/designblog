<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56" title="google-book-reviews" src="http:&#47;&#47;commonplacedesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;google-book-reviews.png" alt=""Freakonomics" on google books with title and shopping options in left column, reviews in center, and ratings histogram and filters for rating, type and source in right column" &#47;><&#47;figure><&#47;div><br />
Google books aggregates reviews from multiple sources. They differentiate between "editorial reviews" (reviews from people whose job it is to write reviews, I guess), and "user reviews" (user-generated content on sites like Goodreads). They allow filtering by star rating, editorial vs user review, and source of the user review.</p>
<p>Individual reviews give the star rating, user name on the source site and name of the source site, and the beginning of the review. There is a "read full review" link back to the source site on each review.</p>
