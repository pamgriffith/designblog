Google books aggregates reviews from multiple sources. They differentiate between "editorial reviews" (reviews from people whose job it is to write reviews, I guess), and "user reviews" (user-generated content on sites like Goodreads). They allow filtering by star rating, editorial vs user review, and source of the user review.

Individual reviews give the star rating, user name on the source site and name of the source site, and the beginning of the review. There is a "read full review" link back to the source site on each review.
