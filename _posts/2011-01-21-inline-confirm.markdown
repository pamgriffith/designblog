{% image big 2011/01/inlineconfirm.jpg alt="A list item with a delete icon which is replaced with 'Delete? yes / no'" %}

I've forgotten where this screenshot comes from, but it shows one item in a list of items, each of which can be deleted. When you click the delete icon, the icon is replaced by a confirmation message right where the button was asking you to confirm that you really wanted to delete it. On the one hand, it's unobtrusive and it appears right where your pointer already is, but on the other it's pretty subtle and I didn't notice it the first time.
